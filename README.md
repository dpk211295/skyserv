Develop an algorithm to determine all vessel proximity events (two vessels having different MMSIs
come within a threshold distance) during a given time frame. The algorithm should be efficient and use
the Haversine formula for distance calculation (link). Consider using one or more of the following
methods to enhance efficiency:
